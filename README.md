# Python-Exploratory Data Analysis
### Project Description:
In this deliverable, you will perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023Links to an external site.). This task aims to analyze, visualize, and interpret the data to extract meaningful insights.
### General Guidelines:
1. Begin by familiarizing yourself with the structure of the dataset. Check for missing values and data types, and perform an initial exploration to understand the different features available.
2. Provide summary statistics to give an overview of key metrics such as the number of streams, release dates, and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability).
3. Use appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to uncover trends and patterns in the data. Ensure that your plots are well-labeled and easy to interpret.
4. Investigate correlations between different variables and provide insights based on your findings. Explore relationships between streams and other musical characteristics like tempo, energy, or playlists.
5. Based on your analysis, offer any insights or recommendations regarding the tracks, artists, or musical trends that could be useful for understanding what makes a track popular.
